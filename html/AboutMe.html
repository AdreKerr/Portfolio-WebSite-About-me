                            <h2>Experience</h2>
                            <ul>When I started learning at MCA I had no experience and had no idea how to do anything
                                realated to codding. Throught that course I learned a lot of things. I learned Visual
                                Stodio code learning html,css,javaScript, and bootstrap. I also learned Visual Stodio
                                Installer were I learned C# and the basics of it. Then for fun we learned GameMaker and
                                how to make some basic games in there. Latter learned abotu xampp to learn mysql and
                                about api's and creating databases.</ul>
                            <li>First learned C#. C# was the first thing that we learned in MCA it was fun to learn new
                                things but wasen't really somehting I liked.</li>
                            <li>Game Maker was learned while learning C#. It was somehtign learned after class to know
                                more and to have a little fun.</li>
                            <li>Second learned html and css. Html was really fun to be able to chosse color and how I
                                wanted something to look.</li>
                            <li>Next learned bootstrap and javaScript. Which are added to html and css to be able to
                                create a lot of fun and cool things. It was were I had the most fun being able to add it
                                all together and be able to create my own things.</li>
